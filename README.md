Universal Pokemon Randomizer

### Version Derpbot 64.0.2

Updates on top of previous changelog below.

See [**Emerald**](https://github.com/DerpBot64/pokeemerald-speedchoice) and [**FireRed**](https://github.com/DerpBot64/firered-speedchoice) for Speedchoice Versions compatible with this fork.

 - Update offsets to support emerald 64.0.1
 - Change rom detection to support more than one rom per version number, by checking against all matching entries for hash matches
 - Bring FireRed randomization in line with emerald, by making fishing slots = 2 for both versions.
 - Include offsets in config for older and dev versions, fixing issues with TmMovesDuplicate config in older versions as well.

### Version Derpbot 64.0.0

 - Update offsets to match firered and emerald 64.0.0
 - Also adds back Wynaut egg to emerald config, since it is now a speedchoice option to force it to be a ditto or not

This is the branch I'm updating to keep up with speedrun-friendly ROM hacks and add some features relevant to speedrun races. Not currently planning to make this into an official release but never say never.
